		 *Create the following four classes: VendingMaching, ItemSlot, Item, and Return
		 *VendingMaching will contain a Map<String, ItemSlot> where the String will represent the location in the vending machine (i.e. "A4") and the ItemSlot
		 *will contain an item, the item's price, and the quantity of that item in that slot
		 *The Item will contain a description
		 *Return will have a field for an Item and a double for any change. The Return is what will be returned to each user using the vending machine.
		 *
		 *VendingMachine should have a method that takes a double (money) and a location (i.e. "A4") and return a Return containing any change and the item.
		 *If the supplied money was insufficient to purchase the item, the Return should contain just the money (item should be null).
		 *
		 *VendingMachine should also have a method that takes an Item, int (quantity), and string (location) and will create an ItemSlot based on the input.
